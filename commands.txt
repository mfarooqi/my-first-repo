for new version


1. Create a New Version (v1.1)

>>git tag -a v1.1 -m "Version 1.1: Updated layout & improvements"
>>git push origin v1.1

2. How to See All Versions?
>>git tag


3. How to Create Future Versions?
 For v1.2, v2.0, etc., just repeat:

>>git tag -a v1.2 -m "Version 1.2: Added animations"
>>git push origin v1.2



4. How to Revert to an Old Version?
git checkout v1.1


---------------------------------


Tomorrow’s Steps for Updating & Tagging v1.1:
1️⃣ Make your updates (modify your portfolio files).
2️⃣ Add & commit changes:
>>git add .
>>git commit -m "Updated portfolio layout and content"


3️⃣ Push changes to GitHub:
>>git push origin main


4️⃣ Tag the new version (v1.1):
>>git tag -a v1.1 -m "Version 1.1: Updated portfolio layout and content"
>>git push origin v1.1


✅ Now your repo has version 1.1 marked! You can continue making more updates and tag future versions the same way.
